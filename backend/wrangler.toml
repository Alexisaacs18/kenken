# backend/wrangler.toml
# Configuration for the API Gateway Worker (TypeScript)

name = "kenken"        # Name of your API Worker
main = "src/index.ts"         # Entry point - adjust path if your TypeScript code is elsewhere
compatibility_date = "2025-12-14"  # Use today's date or a recent one

# Service Binding to Python Algorithm Worker (if you create one)
# Uncomment and configure when you create the Python Worker:
# [[services]]
# binding = "SCORING_ENGINE"         # Variable name in TypeScript code (env.SCORING_ENGINE)
# service = "ai-scoring-python"      # Name of the Python Worker

# Note: If your main TypeScript file is in the root (not src/), change main to "index.ts"
# Note: If you're using the Python Flask backend (api.py), this Worker config is for a future TypeScript migration
